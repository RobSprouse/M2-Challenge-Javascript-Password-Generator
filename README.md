# M2-Challenge-Javascript-Password-Generator

## Description

This Repository was created to complete the University of Richmond's Coding Bootcamp, Module 3 Challenge. The challenge required me to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected.

The following User Story and Acceptance Criteria was used to achieve the primary objective.

> ## User Story
>
> ```
> AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
> I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
> SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
> ```
>
> ## Acceptance Criteria
>
> ```
> GIVEN I need a new, secure password
> WHEN I click the button to generate a password
> THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
> WHEN prompted for password criteria
> THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
> WHEN prompted for the length of the password
> THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
> WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
> THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
> WHEN I answer each prompt
> THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
> WHEN all prompts are answered
> THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
> WHEN the password is generated
> THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
> ```

In addition to meeting the above criteria, I wrote the code to prevent "undefined" errors from appearing when the user's input is invalid.
